  Even though it might be cliched for Koreans since evey man in Korea must serve mandatory military service ,
  however, not only as a person but also for myself, the period of time is the most significant turning point.
  During the time, I became more independent by doing everything on my own, took a tast of responsibility and leadership
  by leading a squad and started to think about my future in a serious manner.
